        <p><i>Lionel Messi is a professional soccer player from Argentina, widely considered one of the greatest players of all time. Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Messi began playing soccer at a young age and quickly showed incredible talent. Messi's father was a factory steel worker, and his mother cleaned houses to support their family. Despite their financial struggles, Messi's parents were determined to support their son's soccer dreams. At the age of six, Messi began playing for a local club called Grandoli. His talent on the field quickly caught the attention of scouts from FC Barcelona, one of the most famous soccer clubs in the world.
